Hello!

Welcome to one of my Portfolio Projects.
In this app, you will find the use of javascript, react, hooks, material-ui, local storage, and mobX-state-tree (along with plenty of other things).
This app is your classic memory game. First, you can select whether you are a dog person or a cat person. Then, you can start the game by clicking one of the cards. Match the pairs as quick as possible and see what time you get (my fastest is 18.2!). You can reset the game with the restart button.
Future features will include user authentication, user profiles, leaderboards, etc. I plan to use node.js and MongoDB to accomplish these additions.
Thanks for stopping by!

Best,
Ryan
